# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: "I am a recent graduate from University of Waterloo with Masters in Electrical in Computer Engineering. With my
specialization in Machine Learning and AI, I plan to start my career with Data Engineering, Data Analyst or Business
Analyst positions. Being a passionate problem solver has always helped me in my academic as well as professional fronts
and I believe it will be one of my important assets in these development roles as well. Having 5 years of experience
in engineering roles, I am now looking forward to shifting my career towards more software development-related fields.
A career shift is never easy but I believe learning and insatiability are the keys. In the long run, I plan to shift my career
path towards technical managerial roles, my work experience as Project Head for engineering projects has added fuel to
set these long-term goals. I am very excited and motivated to start this journey and unfold the various chapters it has in
store for me."

    description: "Designed a Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) system to manage a cluster of nodes running in CentOS 7 and monitor the resource usage.
    Calculated hardware specifications and usage data of each node in a RDBMS database that can be used for future references.
    Used a VM instance created in GCP connected via SSH. Implemented using docker engine and Postgresql with bash scripting."
  - name: "Core Java Apps"

    description:
      - "Twitter App: This Java Twitter app is designed to realize the purposes of a Twitter account which allows users to
                      search, post, and delete tweets via the official Twitter REST APIs. A simplified tweet model is created with required
                      dao, service, and controller layers to access the tweet using an HTTP request. Mockito and JUnit testing are used for
                      the integration and unit testing of this app. Maven dependency model is incorporated to add all the necessary Java
                      libraries (mockito, junit, fasterxml, springframework). This app has also been implemented with Spring framework
                      and docker."
      - "JDBC App: JDBC application is designed to read, write, update and delete (CURD) data against RDBMS using
                   Java DataBase Connectivity (JDBC). JDBC allows a connection between a Java application and RDBMS. Here,
                   Postgresql is used for RDBMS while maintaining the maven project management layout. Different Data Access Objects(DAOs) are used to represent objects that may be simple rows or complex queries. Data Transfer Objects(DTOs)
                   are created using these DAOs."
      - "Grep App: Java Grep application is designed to visualize the usage of the grep app in Linux systems. This app
                   allows users to search for matching strings from files. First, the app is created using for and while loops, which is
                   later realized using lambda and stream APIs. This app has been implemented using Java interface and required
                   library packages including java.io, java.util, and java.slf4j. Exception handling has also been considered with equal
                   importance. Java code is written in IntelliJ IDE with Maven project management outline. Using GCP and VNC
                   for remote VM instance connection, this app is built using a docker engine for easier implementation purposes."
