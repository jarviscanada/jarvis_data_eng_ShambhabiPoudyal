**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShambhabiPoudyal/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Designed a Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) system to manage a cluster of nodes running in CentOS 7 and monitor the resource usage. Calculated hardware specifications and usage data of each node in a RDBMS database that can be used for future references. Used a VM instance created in GCP connected via SSH. Implemented using docker engine and Postgresql with bash scripting.

## Highlighted Projects
**License Plate Detection and Recognition using Joint CNNs**: Implemented cascaded CNN model to detect license plate with high accuracy and speed. Used holistic CNN structure for recognition of detected license plates. Obtained an overall accuracy of 98% on CCPD parking dataset containing wide variety of license plates. Experimented with a total of 250k images. Used Google Colab, Python, NumPy, SciPy, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, Matplotlib, PyPlot

**Minimum Vertex Cover for Street Camera Deployment**: Designed a multi-threaded Linux program to find the minimum number of street camera locations needed to achieve full coverage of a network of roads for traffic management. Visualized this as minimum vertex cover problem and solved using MiniSat solver library. Used C++, Python, MiniSAT solver, Git, CMake, Linux POSIX threads.

**Feature Extraction and Classification on Fashion MNIST Image Dataset**: Implemented machine learning techniques to extract features of images from the dataset and classify them. Compared results of various classifier algorithms to identify the best suited classifier for the dataset. Designed using Python in Google Colab, compared results in Kaggle.

**Object Detection Using Sliding Window for Locating Books in a Library**: Developed image processing model to locate a book of interest in a library setup. Used SIFT, SURF, and ORB feature detection algorithms to find a match of the requested book to recommend precise location in the library. Designed using Image Processing Toolbox in Matlab.
